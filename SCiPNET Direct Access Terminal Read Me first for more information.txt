# SCiPNET Direct Access Terminal

An immersive, browser-based terminal simulator inspired by the SCP Foundation. This project recreates the aesthetics and functionality of a classified database system using a retro-cyberpunk UI, complete with an interactive command-line interface, dynamic event logging, and simulated security clearance levels.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Command Line:** Fully functional terminal input that parses user commands.
* **Security Clearance Simulation:** Users start at Level 0 and must authenticate to access classified materials.
* **Dynamic Event Logging:** Real-time logging of system events, authentication attempts, and database queries in the sidebar.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the terminal looks great on both desktop and mobile screens.
* **No Build Step Required:** 100% vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (via Tailwind CDN). Just drop it in and run.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this project is contained entirely within a single `index.html` file, getting started is incredibly simple.

### Local Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser.

### Hosting on GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Push the `index.html` file to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to your repository **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Pages** section on the left sidebar.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select the `main` (or `master`) branch and click **Save**.
6. Your terminal will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/` within a few minutes!

## 💻 Available Commands

Once the terminal boots up, you can use the following commands:

* `help` - Displays the list of available commands.
* `login` - Prompts for an administrator password to elevate clearance to Level 4. *(Hint: use `admin` or `O5`)*.
* `access [id]` - Attempts to fetch an SCP file from the database (e.g., `access 087`). Requires Level 4 clearance for most files.
* `status` - Displays current facility telemetry and system health.
* `clear` - Clears the terminal output screen.
* `logout` - Revokes clearance, logs the user out, and reboots the terminal sequence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for rapid, utility-first styling)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (for terminal logic and DOM manipulation)
* **Lucide Icons** (for scalable vector icons)
* **Google Fonts** (VT323 for the CRT terminal aesthetic)
